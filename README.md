# Leak Inspection Geospatial Simulation Model

### Overview 
This documnetiation is designed to be a technical document with relation to the example of simulating leak inspection program

<b>The simulation can be used in two different ways</b>
- For simulating leak inspection program with empirical O&G site and service center, please follow <a href= "https://github.com/MozhouGao/Leak-Inspection-Geospatial-Simulation-Model-/blob/main/Run%20simulations%20with%20empirical%20data%20.ipynb"> Run_simulations_with_empirical_data.ipynb </a>
- For simulating leak inspection program with artifical data, please follow <a href= "https://github.com/MozhouGao/Leak-Inspection-Geospatial-Simulation-Model-/blob/main/Run%20simulations%20with%20artificial%20data%20.ipynb"> Run_simulations_with_artifical_data.ipynb </a>

<b>Core functions</b>
- The core functions for the simulation: <a href= "https://github.com/MozhouGao/Leak-Inspection-Geospatial-Simulation-Model-/blob/main/LDAR_dutyholder.py"> LDAR_dutyholder </a>
